# Day-3: Linear Regression on Housing Price Dataset 🏠📉

## 📌 Repository Name
day3-linear-regression-housing

---

## 📖 Description
This repository contains the implementation of **Linear Regression** as part of my **AI & ML Internship (Day-3 Task)**.  
The objective is to understand **simple & multiple regression**, train a predictive model on the **Housing Price dataset**, and evaluate it using standard metrics.

---

## 🚀 Objectives
- Import and preprocess dataset.
- Split data into train/test sets.
- Fit a **Linear Regression model** using `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluate model performance using **MAE, MSE, R²**.
- Visualize regression results and residuals.
- Interpret regression coefficients.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python 3  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Dataset Used**: [Housing Price Prediction Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)  
- Target variable: `medv` (Median value of owner-occupied homes)  

---

## 🔎 Implementation Steps
1. **Data Import & Exploration**  
   - Loaded dataset, checked shape, info, summary stats.  
   - Checked for missing values and correlations.  

2. **Visualization**  
   - Correlation heatmap.  
   - Scatter plots for Actual vs Predicted.  
   - Residual distribution plot.  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Train-Test split (80/20).  
   - Trained `LinearRegression` model.  
   - Extracted coefficients and intercept.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - MAE, MSE, and R² score.  

---

## 📈 Results
- ✅ **Model trained successfully**  
- ✅ **Evaluation metrics printed**  
- ✅ **Visualizations generated**  

Example metrics (values will vary slightly):  
- MAE: ~4.3  
- MSE: ~27.5  
- R²: ~0.71
